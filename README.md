### verdict after writing a simple chat server (commit #1):
time: ~3 hours of coding and googling

*it's actually really good* (i still prefer rust)

it's really simple -- i was able to pick it up pretty quickly (i already knew the constructs of programming and patterns) and wrote a simple chat server.
it's also nice to not have to fight the compiler every 5 lines of code.

a better type system would be nice, i find myself having to runtime check a lot ðŸ¤”. algebraic data types similar to rust's enums would be nice. (*dear stranger: if there's a better way to do what i want to do*, feel free to point it out*)
also the documentation is a lackluster (coming from a rustacean)
